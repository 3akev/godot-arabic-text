# godot-arabic-text

A proof-of-concept-ish frankenstein, made of parts from python-bidi, cpython,
and python-arabic-reshaper, converted to GDScript to work with godot, and wrapped up in a custom node, as a godot plugin.

This thing can display Arabic text, with support for up to one(!) ligature(s).
