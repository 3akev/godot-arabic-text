# godot-arabic-text

A proof-of-concept-ish frankenstein, made of parts from [python-bidi](https://github.com/MeirKriheli/python-bidi), [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython),
and [python-arabic-reshaper](https://github.com/mpcabd/python-arabic-reshaper), converted to GDScript to work with godot, and wrapped up in a custom node, as a godot plugin.

This thing can display Arabic text, with support for up to one(!) ligature(s).
