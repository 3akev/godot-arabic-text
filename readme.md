# This project is deprecated and no longer supported

With the release of [Godot 4 Beta 1](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1), we highly recommend using the 4.x builds for your projects, instead. This project was intended as a stopgap measure to support Arabic in Godot 3.x, and has many limitations.

# Godot Arabic Text

A Godot plugin for correctly displaying Arabic text in Godot 3.x. Currently in Alpha. May work for other RTL languages.
